# Objective
This project is a hands-on learning for enhance my developer skills.

I intend to recreate the design patterns described in the book ["Dive into Design Patterns"](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/book), by Alexander Shvets, to complement my learning with a practical approach and to better understand the difference of these patterns implemented in different languages.

# The project structure
I follow the Shvets book structure that devides the designs in:
 - [Creational](/Creational)
 - Structural
 - Behavioral
